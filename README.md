# üö® Incident Management and Reporting (IMR)

**IMR** is a microservice-driven system that helps detect, manage, and notify stakeholders of various types of incidents in real time. It integrates **monitoring, alerting, and notification delivery** across infrastructure, applications, and business processes.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

IMR addresses three core categories of incidents:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**
    - Examples: High CPU, memory, disk usage
    - Tool: Prometheus

- **Application Errors**
    - Examples: API exceptions, service downtimes
    - Tool: Custom error-reporting from Spring Boot apps

- **Business Events**
    - Examples: Order failures, payment issues
    - Tool: Business logic triggers that post to the Notification Service

## üîî Notification Service

Setup : [View Notification Service README](./notification-service/README.md)


A Notification Service is responsible for sending messages (notifications) to users or systems. These notifications could be in the form of:

Emails

SMS messages

Push notifications

Slack/Teams messages

Webhooks

Key Functions:
Deliver messages reliably

Support multiple channels (email, SMS, etc.)

Retry on failure

Ensure message formatting and localization

Often part of a broader messaging or communication infrastructure

Examples:
AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)

Firebase Cloud Messaging

Twilio

Custom microservices for internal notifications

##  ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Manager

An Alert Manager is a tool or component that manages alerts generated by monitoring systems (like Prometheus, Zabbix, or Datadog).

Key Functions:
Receive alerts from monitoring systems

Group, deduplicate, and silence alerts

Route alerts to the appropriate Notification Services

Apply escalation policies and thresholds

Alert severity and suppression rules

Examples:
Prometheus Alertmanager

PagerDuty

Opsgenie

VictorOps (now Splunk On-Call)
