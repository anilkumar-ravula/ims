# üö® Incident Management and Reporting (IMR)

**IMR** is a microservice-driven system that helps detect, manage, and notify stakeholders of various types of incidents in real time. It integrates **monitoring, alerting, and notification delivery** across infrastructure, applications, and business processes.

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

IMR addresses three core categories of incidents:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**
  - Examples: High CPU, memory, disk usage
  - Tool: Prometheus

- **Application Errors**
  - Examples: API exceptions, service downtimes
  - Tool: Custom error-reporting from Spring Boot apps

- **Business Events**
  - Examples: Order failures, payment issues
  - Tool: Business logic triggers that post to the Notification Service

## üîî Notification Service

üìç **Path:** [`notification-service/`](./notification-service/README.md)

The Notification Service receives structured alert payloads and dispatches messages via different channels.

### Features:

- Multi-channel delivery: Email, Slack, SMS, Webhooks
- Retry and backoff on failures
- Format templates for alerts
- Multi-tenant support
- Encryption/decryption of alert payloads
- Logging and audit of notifications

### Technologies:

- Java Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- RabbitMQ (optional for queuing)
- Kubernetes + Helm

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert Manager

The Alertmanager component handles all routing and filtering of incoming alerts from Prometheus.

### Features:

- Receives alerts from Prometheus via `/api/v1/alerts`
- Routes alerts to Notification Service
- Groups similar alerts
- Deduplicates and suppresses noise
- Supports silences and escalation

### Configuration:

- `alertmanager/config.yaml` includes:
  - Routing rules per use case
  - Receiver endpoints
  - Slack/email integration
